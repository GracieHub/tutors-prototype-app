# TUTORS HIVE APP

Tutors Hive is the front-end user interface for this project that was built to replicate the Tutors Live presence engine feature. This is listening for data from the Tutors Simulator Realtime Database and arrangeing this data into a layout, as discussed in [project Final Report](https://github.com/GracieHub/tutors-prototype-app/blob/main/Grace_20002141_Project%20Final%20report.pdf). This project is linked to another repo [Tutors Simulator App](https://github.com/GracieHub/tutors-simulator-app) which is  simulating student data to the Tutors Simulator Realtime database.
